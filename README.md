#### Introduction

Phishing attacks remain one of the most common and damaging forms of cyber threats. Attackers use phishing emails, websites, and messages to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as credentials, or installing malware. Organizations must adopt a structured response plan to effectively handle phishing incidents and protect sensitive data. This article presents a comprehensive workflow for mitigating phishing risks, covering the stages of detection, analysis, containment and eradication, recovery, and post-incident improvement.

#### Objectives

The main objectives of a phishing incident response plan include:

1. **Early Detection**: Quickly identify phishing attempts to limit exposure.
2. **Thorough Analysis**: Assess the scope and potential damage caused by phishing incidents.
3. **Effective Containment and Eradication**: Block phishing sources and prevent further malicious activities.
4. **Comprehensive Recovery**: Secure affected systems and restore functionality.
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Enhance defenses and raise awareness to prevent future phishing attempts.

By following these objectives, organizations can mitigate the impact of phishing attacks and strengthen their overall cybersecurity posture.

#### Security Requirements

An effective phishing incident response requires the following security measures:

1. **Spam Filters and Anti-Phishing Tools**: These solutions detect and block phishing emails before they reach users.
2. **EDR and SIEM Systems**: Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems help detect, isolate, and analyze phishing attempts.
3. **Access Control and MFA**: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) helps prevent unauthorized access, even if credentials are compromised.
4. **User Awareness Training**: Educating users on how to recognize phishing attempts is critical for minimizing successful attacks.
5. **Incident Response Playbooks**: Detailed playbooks provide a step-by-step response to phishing incidents, ensuring consistent handling across the organization.

#### Incident Response Workflow

The incident response workflow for phishing incidents is divided into five stages: Detection, Analysis, Containment/Eradication, Recovery, and Post-Incident. Each stage includes specific actions to manage and mitigate the threat effectively.

### 1. Detection

In this phase, the goal is to detect phishing attempts early to prevent damage.

- **Alerts and Notifications**: Receive alerts from spam filters, SIEM, or user reports about potential phishing emails.
  
- **Identify Threat Indicators**: Look for common phishing indicators such as suspicious links, attachments, and senders.
  
- **Identify Risk Factors**: Assess potential impacts on financials, reputation, and sensitive data.
  
- **Data Collection**: Collect relevant information such as sender details, URLs, and the scope of phishing attempts.
  
- **Triage and Initial Assessment**: Determine the severity of the incident, identifying if it’s a false positive or a legitimate phishing attack.

*Outcome*: Confirmed phishing incidents move to the Analysis phase for further investigation.

### 2. Analysis

In this phase, the phishing incident is thoroughly examined to understand its impact and reach.

- **Verification**: Double-check data and rule out false positives.
  
- **Identify Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**: Validate email headers, links, and attachments, and search threat intelligence sources for IoCs.
  
- **Enterprise Scan**: Update spam filters and scan for similar phishing attempts across the organization.
  
- **Scope Validation**: Determine which systems and users were affected, reviewing emails and endpoints for IoCs.
  
- **Update Scope**: Identify and update lists of affected entities, including endpoints, email addresses, and business units.
  
- **Send Communications**: Notify internal security teams and affected departments, ensuring all parties are aware of the threat.

*Outcome*: A clear understanding of the phishing attack’s scope and the affected entities, guiding the containment process.

### 3. Contain and Eradicate

This stage focuses on stopping the phishing attack, removing malicious content, and securing systems.

- **Block C2 and Email Traffic**: Use spam filters, firewalls, and proxies to block malicious links and Command and Control (C2) communications.
  
- **Evaluate User Actions**: Determine if users interacted with the phishing content, such as clicking links or downloading attachments.
  
- **Delete Phishing Emails**: Remove phishing emails from user inboxes and email servers to prevent further exposure.
  
- **Close Monitoring**: Continue monitoring for related phishing attempts and check if there are additional IoCs.

*Outcome*: The phishing threat is contained, and malicious emails are removed from the environment, minimizing further risk.

### 4. Recovery

In this stage, recovery actions are implemented to secure systems and restore normal functionality.

- **Update Defenses**: Adjust spam filters, firewall rules, and other defenses to prevent future phishing incidents.
  
- **Data Collection**: Confirm that no legitimate sites or emails are being blocked by the updated rules.
  
- **Validate Endpoint Security**: Ensure that all affected endpoints are identified and secure.

*Outcome*: Systems are fully recovered, and defenses are in place to prevent similar phishing attempts in the future.

### 5. Post-Incident Review

The final phase focuses on learning from the incident to strengthen defenses and prevent future attacks.

- **Incident Review**: Assess response effectiveness, documenting what worked well and what could be improved.
  
- **Policy and Procedure Updates**: Update phishing-related policies and response playbooks based on lessons learned.
  
- **Review Defensive Posture**: Ensure detection rules, spam filters, and firewalls are optimized to detect similar attacks.
  
- **User Awareness Training**: Conduct phishing awareness sessions if human error contributed to the incident.
  
- **Cost Calculation**: Document the financial and operational impact of the phishing incident.

*Outcome*: The organization is better prepared to handle future phishing attempts, with enhanced defenses and improved response protocols.

#### Conclusion

Phishing incidents pose significant risks to organizations, necessitating a comprehensive response plan to minimize damage. By following a structured workflow from detection to post-incident review, organizations can effectively manage phishing attacks and prevent recurrence. This approach not only mitigates immediate risks but also strengthens the organization’s cybersecurity resilience.
